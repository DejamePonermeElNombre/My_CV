# Project analysis


## Target user profile

The final user will be members of the Human Resources department or a business owner, who may be searching a profile qualified in software development and experienced in the field as well. 

They probably expect to find which my skills are and how good I am at them. If they also need someone who knows several languages (spoken and programming languages), my CV could be appealing to them.

## Information architecture

This project is a single-page project.

## Visual design

The CV is centred and divided in several parts, each one of them using *sans-serif* as their typography:

* **Header:** Its background colour has gradient, starting with a slightly dark blue on top and it gets lighter as it goes down. In this section there is information such as my name, profile picture, contact information and who I am based on my studies. All text is in colour white, so it is easy to distinguish from the background.

* **Information:** This section is dedicated to show information, such as my education, experience and skills to name a few. This section is also divided into parts with their own titles. These titles' colour is blue, similar to the dark blue on the top of the header. This section is also divided into parts:

    * **About me, skills, hobbies:** For specific information, such as my birth or the languages I can speak, its title is in bold (for example: **Birth:** anuary 20th, 1986 (Rome, Italy)).

    * **Education:** The title got and the name of the programms I took part are in bold and light blue, while the place where I got them is in bold and italics.
    
    * **Experience:** The name of the place where I worked is in bold and light blue, while the ocupation is in bold and italics.
    
    * **Awards:** In this part, the name of the award is in bold and light blue.
